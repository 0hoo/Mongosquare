# Contributing

Contributors help keep a project growing and alive.

In a project like this, contributing code can be very intimidating, but that doesn't mean that you can't help.

## Contributing code

The best way to start contributing code is by reading the codebase. One way to approach that is by contributing (inline) documentation for the code at hand.

This way you're reading how the code at hand works and helps future contributors and users understand the code better, too.
